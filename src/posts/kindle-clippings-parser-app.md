# Kindle clippings parser

[This application](https://sychd.github.io/kindle-clippings-parser/)  is designed to parse your Kindle notes into a convenient Markdown format. Before creating it, I searched online for similar tools and came across MyClippings.

However, it turned out that it requires a paid subscription to access your notes in full. That's why this application was created—for both you and me—to retrieve notes completely and for free. Enjoy!
