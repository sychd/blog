## What is it about?

In the past, there are moments one would like to forget forever, to simply cast them out of their mind. Humanity found a way to achieve this by transferring their soul-wrenching wounds to others—experiencers. Anyone could book an appointment, much like visiting a doctor, and offload a part of their past onto the shoulders of a specialist.

Rain Fischer, one such professional, had extensive experience and had endured countless memories that kept others awake at night. Yet, he skillfully detached himself from the emotional turmoil, ensuring that his work never interfered with his life.

But one day, the experiencer received a special assignment that went beyond the confines of the consultation room.
