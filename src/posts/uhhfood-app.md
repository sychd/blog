# Uhhfood - check what is inside!

[An application](https://uhhfood.vercel.app/check) that helps you scan ingredients to evaluate whether a product is suitable or preferable for consumption.

The idea originally came from my girlfriendâ€”she suggested the possibility of using AI to check ingredients. I explored the concept, put in some work, and eventually developed the app.

While it's still quite limited, it's useful and completely free to use. On my end, I only pay for an AI API, and that's it. Vercel allows to host the application for free at the moment.
